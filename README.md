# DSAVisualiser

This is a project I worked on between March and September of 2022.  
The idea came from my university course having a Data Structures and Algorithms module starting in September of 2022.

I selected 6 Data Structures, and 6 Algorithms that I thought visualisation would be useful in the learning of.  
I didn't include Hash Maps, for example, because I feel that once you understand Hashing, a tool to show the compound with a basic Array isn't especially useful.

The project is built using Java and the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx">LibGDX</a> framework.
